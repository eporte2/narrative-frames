# narrative-frames
### For .txtlab@McGill,  detect scene changes in novels.

This is an R-script for detection the locations of frame/scene changes. There are two hyperparameters - window size and step size. These can be changed though they are currently set at what we found to be optimum while testing.

All instructions on use are provided in comment form in script.
